The script you provided has encountered an error:
{info_text}

COMMON ERROR PATTERNS TO CHECK:
1. "kth-oldest"/"kth-cheapest" should use position k directly (NOT N+1-k)
   - "second-oldest" → 2, NOT N-1 or N+1-2
   - "third-cheapest" → 3, NOT N+1-3
2. "kth-newest"/"kth-most expensive" should use N+1-k
   - "second-most expensive" → N+1-2, NOT 2
   - "third-newest" → N+1-3
3. "kth from the right" should use N+1-k (NOT N-k)
   - "second from the right" (N=5) → 4, NOT 3
4. Comparison direction:
   - "A below B" (golf) → A > B (worse rank = bigger number)
   - "A above B" (golf) → A < B (better rank = smaller number)
   - "A older than B" → A < B (older = smaller position)
   - "A newer than B" → A > B (newer = bigger position)
