The script you provided does not match the semantics of the original problem. This is the detailed information for checking semantic inconsistencies:
{info_text}

COMMON SEMANTIC ERRORS TO FIX:
1. Position calculation errors:
   - "kth-oldest"/"kth-cheapest" → use k directly (e.g., "second-oldest" = 2)
   - "kth-newest"/"kth-most expensive" → use N+1-k (e.g., "second-most expensive" when N=7 is 6)
   - "kth from right" → use N+1-k (NOT N-k)
2. Comparison operator direction:
   - "below" in golf means WORSE rank = BIGGER number, so use >
   - "above" in golf means BETTER rank = SMALLER number, so use <
   - "older" means SMALLER position, "newer" means BIGGER position
   - "more expensive" means BIGGER position, "less expensive" means SMALLER position
3. Make sure you haven't swapped the direction of < and >

Please resolve the issue again and ensure that the semantics remain unchanged:
