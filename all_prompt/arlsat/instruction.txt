You should write in the format as comment in python script as follows:
# Define variables for all entities and constraints
# Create a solver instance: `solver = Solver()`
# Add constraints based on the problem description
# Create statements to be checked
# Check if the statement is satisfied and return the correct option letter

You must meet the following requirements:
1. The output should be a python script of the format ```python <code generate> ```
2. Use appropriate Z3 variables (Bool, Int, etc.) based on the problem type
3. Encode all constraints from the problem description
4. Return only a single letter (A, B, C, D, or E) as the final answer
5. Comment which option each letter represents
