The script you provided has encountered an error:
{info_text}

⚠️⚠️⚠️ THIS ERROR IS ALMOST ALWAYS CAUSED BY MISSING COMMAS ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Check your code line by line for these EXACT patterns:

WRONG (will cause "invalid syntax" error):
```python
And(Cold(x) Red(x))           # Missing comma!
Or(Big(x) Green(x))           # Missing comma!
Implies(A(x) B(x))            # Missing comma!
Implies(And(A(x) B(x)) C(x))  # Missing comma in And!
```

CORRECT (with commas):
```python
And(Cold(x), Red(x))          # Comma between arguments!
Or(Big(x), Green(x))          # Comma between arguments!
Implies(A(x), B(x))           # Comma between arguments!
Implies(And(A(x), B(x)), C(x))  # Commas everywhere!
```

⚠️ SCAN YOUR ENTIRE CODE for:
1. Every And(...) - does it have commas between ALL arguments?
2. Every Or(...) - does it have commas between ALL arguments?
3. Every Implies(...) - does it have EXACTLY 2 arguments with comma?
4. Nested functions like Implies(And(...), ...) - check BOTH the inner And AND the outer Implies!

Please fix ALL missing commas and regenerate the complete code:
