The script you provided has encountered an error:
{info_text}

**Common error patterns and how to fix them:**

**ERROR TYPE 1: Variable not defined**
Pattern: "name 'X' is not defined"
Fix: Define ALL variables at the top BEFORE using them
- Scan the ENTIRE context and question first
- List ALL predicates you'll need
- Define ALL boolean variables before adding any constraints

Example of WRONG code:
```python
solver.add(Implies(rock_is_rabbit, rock_is_cute))  # ❌ rock_is_cute not defined yet!
```

Example of CORRECT code:
```python
# Define ALL variables first
rock_is_rabbit = Bool("rock_is_rabbit")
rock_is_cute = Bool("rock_is_cute")  # ✅ Now defined!
# Then add constraints
solver.add(Implies(rock_is_rabbit, rock_is_cute))
```

**ERROR TYPE 2: Query added to base constraints**
Pattern: Wrong answer (predicted A but correct is C, or predicted C but correct is A/B)
Fix: NEVER add the query statement to the base solver before testing!
- Only add context rules to base solver
- Test query using push/pop

Example of WRONG code:
```python
solver = Solver()
solver.add(Implies(economic_hardship, provides_aid))
solver.add(Not(provides_aid))  # ❌ Adding query negation before testing!
# Now test...
```

Example of CORRECT code:
```python
solver = Solver()
# Add ONLY context constraints
solver.add(Implies(economic_hardship, provides_aid))

# Test query using push/pop
solver.push()
solver.add(provides_aid)  # ✅ Test if aid can be true
can_be_true = (solver.check() == sat)
solver.pop()

solver.push()
solver.add(Not(provides_aid))  # ✅ Test if aid can be false
can_be_false = (solver.check() == sat)
solver.pop()
```

**ERROR TYPE 3: Z3 internal errors (index out of bounds / unreachable)**
Pattern: "index out of bounds" / "unreachable" / Z3 crashes
Fix: Simplify your constraints
- Avoid deeply nested logical expressions
- Break complex constraints into multiple simpler ones
- Don't create redundant or circular constraints (e.g., Implies(X, X))
- For "All X are Y", use simple: Implies(is_X, is_Y)
- For "Some X exist", just note it (no constraint needed)

Example of WRONG code:
```python
solver.add(Implies(rock_is_monkey, rock_is_monkey))  # ❌ Redundant, useless!
```

**ERROR TYPE 4: Missing contradiction detection**
Pattern: Should detect logical impossibility but doesn't
Fix: Check if assumptions lead to contradictions
- If adding a statement makes solver UNSAT, that statement is impossible

Example:
```python
# Test: Can X be true?
solver.push()
solver.add(X)
can_be_true = (solver.check() == sat)
solver.pop()

if not can_be_true:
    # X leads to contradiction, so "NOT X" must be True!
    print("A")  # If question asks "NOT X"
```

Please carefully review your code for these patterns and fix the error:
