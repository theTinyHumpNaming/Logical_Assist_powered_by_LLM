You should write in the format as comment in python script as follows:
# Define boolean variables for all entities: <the entities you generate>
# Create a solver instance: `solver = Solver()`
# Parse the problem into relationships: <Relationships you generate>
# Create statements to be checked: <Statements to be checked>
# Check if satisfy the condition: print A if the statement is true and B if the statement is false

You must meet the following requirements:
1. The output should be a python script of the format ```python <code generate> ```
2. All boolean variables should be defined, and you should only define each variable once, not multiple times.
3. Number of Relationships you generate should be the same as number of sentences in the [Problem] (A sentence is defined as ending with ".").
