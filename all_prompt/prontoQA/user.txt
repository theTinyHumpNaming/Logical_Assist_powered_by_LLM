Task Description: You are given a problem description and a question. The task is to write a python script which includes:
1) Define all variables for all entities in the problem. You should write a comment indicating which sentence the entity is in.
2) Create a solver instance.
3) Parse the problem into relationships based on the defined entities, you should only use 'Implies' and 'Not' in this part. You should write a comment indicating which sentence the relationship is in.
4) Create statements to be checked.
5) Check if the solver can find a model that satisfies the conditions, if true, return A, if false, return B.

Following is an example to follow:
Problem:
Every zumpus is aggressive. Zumpuses are Wumpuses. Wumpuses are not small. Wumpuses are aggressive. Polly is zumpus.
Question:
Is the following statement true or false? Polly is not small.
Options:
A) True
B) False

```python
from z3 import *

# Define boolean variables for all entities
# Every zumpus is aggressive
zumpus = Bool("zumpus")
aggressive = Bool("aggressive")

# Zumpuses are Wumpuses
# zumpus has been defined before
wumpus = Bool("wumpus")

# Wumpuses are not small.
# Wumpuses has been defined before
small = Bool("small")

# Wumpuses are aggressive.
# Wumpuses has been defined before
# Aggressive has been defined before

# Polly is zumpus.
polly = Bool("polly")
# Zumpuses has been defined before

# Create a solver instance
solver = Solver()

# Parse the problem into relationships
# Every zumpus is aggressive
solver.add(Implies(zumpus, aggressive))
# Zumpuses are Wumpuses
solver.add(Implies(zumpus, wumpus))
# Wumpuses are not small
solver.add(Implies(wumpus, Not(small)))
# Wumpuses are aggressive
solver.add(Implies(wumpus, aggressive))
# Polly is zumpus
solver.add(Implies(polly, zumpus))

# Create facts in the problem
solver.add(polly)

# Create statements to be checked
# Polly is not small.
solver.add(polly, Not(small))

# Check if the solver can find a model that satisfies the conditions
if solver.check() == sat:
    print("A") # The statement is true
else:
    print("B") # The statement is false
```
